Existing black-box adversarial attacks on voice assistants either apply substitution models orleverage the intermediate model output to estimate the gradientsfor crafting adversarial audio samples. However, these attack approaches require a significant amount of queries with a lengthy training stage. Our attack leverages the decision-based attack to produce effective adversarial audios, and reduces the number ofqueries by optimizing the gradient estimation. In the experiments, we perform our attack against 4 different speech-to-text APIs under 3 real-world scenarios to demonstrate the real-time attack impact. The results also show that our attack is practical and robust in attacking 5 popular commercial voice controllable devices over theair. The benchmark result shows we can generate adversarial examples and launch the attack in a couple of minutes. We improve the query efficiency and reduce the cost of a success-ful untargeted and targeted adversarial attack by 93.1% and 65.5% compared with the state-of-the-art black-box attacks, using only‚àº300 and‚àº1,500 queries, respectively.","tags":[],"title":"Black-Box, Query-Efficient Audio Adversarial Attacks","type":"event"},{"authors":["Chenning Li","Hanqing Guo","Shuai Tong","Xiao Zeng","Zhichao Cao","Mi Zhang","Qiben Yan","Li Xiao","Jiliang Wang","Yunhao Liu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641089022,"objectID":"5da359791df8949e5ce4f126921338ae","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/li-2021-nelora/","publishdate":"2022-01-02T02:03:40.111816Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-2021-nelora/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"NELoRa: Towards Ultra-low SNR LoRa Communication with Neural-enhanced Demodulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nikolay Ivanov","Hanqing Guo","Qiben Yan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641089020,"objectID":"18435a9c1ce03329a7b0d8cb6fe24b61","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/ivanov-2021-rectifying/","publishdate":"2022-01-02T02:03:38.259445Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ivanov-2021-rectifying/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Rectifying Administrated ERC20 Tokens","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Motivation:   Ultrasound in Speech:       Decision-Boundary: We find that the decision boundary in speech to text model is different from it in computer vision models.

However, they often have high error rates and/orlong delays. In this paper, we explore a new direction of humanvoice research by scrutinizing the unique characteristics of humanspeech at the ultrasound frequency band. Our research indicatesthat the high-frequency ultrasound components (e.g. speech fricatives) from 20 to 48 kHz can significantly enhance the security andaccuracy of speaker verification. We propose a speaker verification system, which uses a two-stream DNN architecture with a feature fusion mechanism to generate distinctive speaker models. To test the system, we create a speech dataset with 12 hours of audio (9,050 voice samples) from 128 participants. In addition, we create a second spoofed voice dataset to evaluate its security. In order to balance between controlled recordings and real-world applications, the audio recordings are collected from two quiet rooms by 8 different recording devices, including 7 smartphones and an ultrasound microphone. Our evaluation shows that our system achieves 0.58% equal error rate in the speaker verification task, which reduces the best equal error rate of the existing systems by 86.1%. Besides, our system only takes 120 ms for testing an incoming utterance,  within 91 ms processing time, we achieve 0% equal error rate in detecting replay attacks launched by 5 different loudspeakers.","tags":[],"title":"Ultrasound Enabled Speaker Authentication","type":"event"},{"authors":["Hanqing Guo","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
